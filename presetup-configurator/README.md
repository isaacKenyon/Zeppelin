# Zeppelin Presetup-Configurator Tool

This is a tool written to assist new users (and support techs.) in creating sample configs so that bot operators can get Zeppelin running ASAP! It is designed as a framework with the idea that other plugins will be further added per the operators' needs. It
is not possible to edit the config window, so using a notepad tool is recommend for further config manipulation. 

It is written in React using Vite as a build-step.
